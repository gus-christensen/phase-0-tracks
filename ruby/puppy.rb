#the puppy class should be very focused on sculpting a viable adult dog.
#
#for instance, a method called #peeing_in_the_house,
#the owner should IMMEDIATELY respond, catching the pup in the act
#to properly correct the pup, DURING the bad act.
#followed by a walk outside/proper dissemination of discipline-related stress
#
#similarly, a chewing or teething method
#would prompt IMMEDIATE response from the owner
#startling the pup while in the act
#followed by providing a replacement chewing option
#and de-stressing.
#
#Leash training method is much much more involved.
