Planning jQuery binge:

1. learn basic syntax for implementation (30min) search for very short youtubes. and text-based tutorials.

2. find many cheat sheets, looking specifically for ones that are less design-oriented and more focused on functionality (10min)

3. simultaneously acquire what types of functions are available while also learning their syntax (1hour)

4. spend some time exploring design/layout/interface functions, specifically looking for unfamiliar forms of syntax to better understand jQuery as a quasi-language.





Youtube was mildly helpful, though no video was enough on it's own.  Experimentation with html has yielded to most results.
