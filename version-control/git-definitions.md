# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful? 
 Version control allows one or several team members to make changes to his/her/their clone before merging the work back to the master.  It also leaves traces of the these steps in the collaborate process.  This can be useful to make even very complicated collaborations much more organized with step by step histories of the work process.
* What is a branch and why would you use one??????
 Branches are where experimental work, or work in flux, can be saved/ modified before being merged into a master.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
 A commit is a save point where changes are made to a branch or master with an accompanying message that explains to the developer or his/her team what modifications have been made. A good commit message is simple and direct about the changes made, and for some unknown reason it is in the present tense.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict happens when a branch do not cleanly graft onto the master tree because other branches have been merged, modifying the master. To resolve the conflict, edit the conflicting changes and git add the modified file to the master.
